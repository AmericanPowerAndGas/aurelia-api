This library is an unofficial plugin for the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform and contains a simple client which extends the functionalities supplied by [aurelia-fetch-client](https://github.com/aurelia/fetch-client).
This library plays nice with the [Sails.js framework](http://sailsjs.org).

## Used By

This library is used directly by applications only.

## Platform Support

This library can be used in the **browser** only.

## Installation
Installing this module is fairly simple.

Run `jspm install github:spoonx/aurelia-api` from your project root.

## Usage

### Configuring the client

Make sure your project uses a `main.js` file to initialize aurelia. In your configure function, add the following:

```javascript
import {HttpClient} from 'aurelia-fetch-client';
let yourEndpoint = 'http://localhost:1337/';

aurelia.start().then(a => {
    a.container.get(HttpClient).configure(builder => {
      builder.useStandardConfiguration().withBaseUrl(yourEndpoint);
    });
  });
```

### Rest client
To use the Rest client, simply import it and get cracking!

Here's an example:

```javascript
import {Rest} from 'spoonx/aurelia-api';

@inject(Rest)
export class MyViewModel {
  constructor (restClient) {
    restClient.find('product', {
        category: 5,
        name    : {contains: 'mouse'}
      })
      .then(console.log)
      .catch(console.error);
  }
}
```
